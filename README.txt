# Teach Me Quantum

A university-level course on **Quantum Computing** and **Quantum Information Science** that incorporates IBM Q Experience and Qiskit. 
This course is adequate for general audiences without prior knowledge on Quantum Mechanics and Quantum Computing (see #prior-knowledge), has an estimated average duration of **10 weeks at 3h/week** (see #duration) and is meant to be the entrypoint into the **Quantum World**.

This course is **Open-source** and appropriate for both _autodidacticism_ as well as _classroom teaching_ by educators, professors and lecturers in their own classes. Given the dynamic nature of the topic, any open-source contributions and future improvements are welcome.

## Course Overview
 * Week 0 - Hello Quantum World
 * Week 1 - Quantum Tools
 * Week 2 - Quantum Information Science
 * Week 3 - Quantum Gates
 * Week 4 - Quantum Facts
 * Week 5 - Quantum Algorithms
 * Week 6 - Quantum Search
 * Week 7 - Quantum Factorization
 * Week 8 - High Level Quantum Programming
 * Week 9 - State of the Quantum Art

## Prior Knowledge
Students of this course are expected to be familiar with (this can be done while going through the course):
 * Python language
 * Jupyter Notebook environment
 * Some linear algebra

## Learning Goals
After completing this course, students should be able to:
 * Understand the basics of Quantum Mechanics
 * Know how a computing model can be built around Quantum Mechanics
 * Understand the advantages, disadvantages and implications of Quantum Computing
 * UndersandQiskitum Information Science and how it contrasts with classical information theory
 * Leverage QISKit towards research and development in the _Quantum World_
 * Understand the empirical differences between Quantum Simulators and real Quantum Devices (such as those available in IBMQ)
 * Design, interpret and deploy quantum circuits (simulators and real processors)
 * Know and describe a few of the most common quantum algorithms: Deutsch, Grover, Shor
 * Be able to quickly understand new quantum algorithms based on the same principles: Simon, ...
 * Be able to quickly understand new principles of quantum computing: Adiabatic, ...
 * Understand the impact that the advance of quantum computers can have on the world as we know it
 * Understand High Level applications of near-end quantum algorithms, namely how to use qiskit-aqua for solving real world problems
 * Move on to deeper waters, by exploring according to their heart's desire!

## Duration
 * Estimated average duration of **10 weeks at 3h/week**
 * Duration is flexible depending on level of depth a teacher imposes on each week.
 * Usually 1h theory + 2h practice, except for:
     * week 0 (1h + 0h = 1h)
     * week 1 (1h + 1h = 2h)
     * week 9 (2h + 0h = 2h)
* Estimated total time: **25h to 30h**.
