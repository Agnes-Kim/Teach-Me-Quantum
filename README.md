<h1 align="center">Teach Me Quantum</h1>

A university-level course on **Quantum Computing** and **Quantum Information Science** that incorporates [IBM Q Experience](https://quantumexperience.ng.bluemix.net/qx/experience) and [Qiskit](https://www.qiskit.org/). This course is adequate for general audiences without prior knowledge on Quantum Mechanics and Quantum Computing (please read to [prior knowledge](#prior-knowledge) before starting) and has an estimated duration of **10 weeks at 2h/week (usually 1h theory + 1h practice)**.

This course is Open-source and fit for both individual learning as well as to be used by teachers, professors and lecturers in their own classes.

## Prior Knowledge
Students of this course are expected to be familiar with (this can be done while going through the course):
 * [Python](https://www.python.org/) language
 * [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) Notebook environment
 * Linear algebra basics, such as: inner and outer products, eigenvalues, norms, transpose, adjoints (complex conjugates), tensor product, ...

## Learning Goals
After completing this course, students should be able to:
 * Understand ...
 * Leverage QISKit for Quantum research and development
 * ...

## Working with PDF slides
Each `.pdf` file for slides may have two versions `NAME.pdf` and `NAME_animated.pdf`. The first ignores animations (by replacing the document class in any `.tex` file for `\documentclass[handout]{beamer}`) and the second contains animations.

Animated slides will only work with an external program, I advise [dannyedel/dspdfviewer](https://github.com/dannyedel/dspdfviewer/releases) which also has dual screen and timer functionality.

## Compiling LaTeX files
To achieve this use any LaTeX compiler of your choice, if you have [pdflatex](https://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex/) you can simply do `pdflatex week_XX.tex`.

## Aditional notes
Each week's slides has a particular theme, that is to help students distinguish between them and strengthen the learning process by fostering association.
